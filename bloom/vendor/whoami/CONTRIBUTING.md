# Contributing
Anyone is welcome to contribute!  You can [open an issue],
[Post to GitHub Discussions] or [send me an email] about anything related to
this project.  You may also [open a PR].  I don't require PRs to be formatted in
a specific manner, since I'll run it through rustfmt after the merge anyway.  If
you're going to work on a PR, it would be preferred to let me know ahead of time
(unless it's a quick fix), and open a draft PR if it's a large one.  Then I'll
assign the issue to you.  Otherwise, I can't guarantee I won't duplicate your
work.  If I can't contact you within a week, I may unassign you and finish your
work (opening a Draft PR on this repository puts your code under this crate's
license).

If you open a bug report, you can usually expect it to be fixed within a week.
If you open a feature request it may stay open indefinitely, until I need it
too.  I mark feature requests as "enhancements" on GitHub issues.

Happy coding!

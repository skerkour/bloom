//! A persistent vector.
//!
//! This is a sequence of elements in insertion order - if you need a
//! list of things, any kind of list of things, this is what you're
//! looking for.
//!
//! It's implemented as an [RRB vector][rrbpaper] with [smart
//! head/tail chunking][chunkedseq]. In performance terms, this means
//! that practically every operation is O(log n), except push/pop on
//! both sides, which will be O(1) amortised, and O(log n) in the
//! worst case. In practice, the push/pop operations will be
//! blindingly fast, nearly on par with the native
//! [`VecDeque`][VecDeque], and other operations will have decent, if
//! not high, performance, but they all have more or less the same
//! O(log n) complexity, so you don't need to keep their performance
//! characteristics in mind - everything, even splitting and merging,
//! is safe to use and never too slow.
//!
//! ## Performance Notes
//!
//! Because of the head/tail chunking technique, until you push a
//! number of items above double the tree's branching factor (that's
//! `self.len()` = 2 × *k* (where *k* = 64) = 128) on either side, the
//! data structure is still just a handful of arrays, not yet an RRB
//! tree, so you'll see performance and memory characteristics fairly
//! close to [`Vec`][Vec] or [`VecDeque`][VecDeque].
//!
//! This means that the structure always preallocates four chunks of
//! size *k* (*k* being the tree's branching factor), equivalent to a
//! [`Vec`][Vec] with an initial capacity of 256. Beyond that, it will
//! allocate tree nodes of capacity *k* as needed.
//!
//! In addition, vectors start out as single chunks, and only expand into the
//! full data structure once you go past the chunk size. This makes them
//! perform identically to [`Vec`][Vec] at small sizes.

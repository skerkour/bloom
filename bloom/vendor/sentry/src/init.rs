/// call `mem::forget` on it.

/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let _sentry = sentry::init("https://key@sentry.io/1234");
/// ```
///
/// Or if draining on shutdown should be ignored:
/// This is not recommended, as events or session updates that have been queued
/// might be lost.
///
/// ```
/// std::mem::forget(sentry::init("https://key@sentry.io/1234"));

///
/// The guard returned can also be inspected to see if a client has been
/// created to enable further configuration:
///
/// ```
/// let sentry = sentry::init(sentry::ClientOptions {
///     release: Some("foo-bar-baz@1.0.0".into()),
///     ..Default::default()
/// });
/// if sentry.is_enabled() {

/// }

///
/// This behaves similar to creating a client by calling `Client::from_config`
/// and to then bind it to the hub except it also applies default integrations,
/// a default transport, as well as other options populated from environment
/// variables.
/// For more information about the formats accepted see `Client::from_config`,
/// and `ClientOptions`.
///

///
/// This will panic when the provided DSN is invalid.
/// If you want to handle invalid DSNs you need to parse them manually by
/// calling `parse` on it and handle the error.
